I've got the biggest secret to share with you - I'm totally crushing on someone! I know, I know, it's not exactly earth-shattering news coming from me. But this one is different, I swear.

This person is just...wow. Like, how can one human being be so perfect? Their smile makes my heart do backflips. I find myself going out of my way just to be around them, even if it's just for a few minutes. 

The only problem is, I don't think they have any idea I exist. I mean, why would someone that incredible ever notice little old me, right? I feel like I turn into a bumbling, blushing mess every time we're in the same room. Real smooth, I know.

Anyway, I know she already knew that I have a crush on her, haha lets just go with the flow. </p>
